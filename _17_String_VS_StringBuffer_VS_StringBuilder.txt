/////////////////// String VS StringBuffer VS StringBuilder  ////////////////////////////////////


When the content is fixed and won't change frequently, we should go for STRING.

When the content keeps on changing frequently, and THREAD SAFETY is required, then we should go for STRING_BUFFER.

When the content keeps on changing frequently, and THREAD SAFETY is NOT required, then we should go for STRING_BUILDER.



/////// String class is THREAD SAFE as it IMMUTABLE, so no thread can Manipulate it's content.
/////// Similarly other Immutable class (WRAPPER CLASS) is also THREAD SAFE.

1.) Why SCP concept is applicable to String but not for StringBuffer ?????


    String is most commonly used(regular customer :) ) Object in Java, so it has some special privileges for memory management.
    While SB is rarely used so SCP concept is not required for SB.



2.) Why String objects are Immutable and StringBuffer objects are Mutable ?????

    Because of SCP, in String, same Object can be reused by assigning multiple references. So there may be a chance that one
    reference try to change the content of the object!! So to overcome this problem, Java People made String Class IMMUTABLE.
    In case of SB, no SCP concept is applicable, so it is not required to make SB IMMUTABLE, so SB is MUTABLE.



3.) In addition to String Objects, any other object is IMMUTABLE in JAVA ??????

    Yes, all WRAPPER class objects are also IMMUTABLE.
